    "# Hands-On Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Module 2, machine learning is about optimizing over a loss.\n",
    "How well a machine learning model performs depends on both the hypothesis and loss function that we choose to use.\n",
    "This general framework goes under the name of *[empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will walk you through the basic steps of empirical risk minimization: the optimization problem at the heart of most modern-day machine learning systems.\n",
    "We will use a simple motivating example for an end-to-end demonstration: predicting whether a patient with a given antigen test value is infected with Covid-19.\n",
    "Using the same synthetic Covid-19 dataset you worked with in Hands-On Assignment 1,\n",
    "we will train a simple [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)\n",
    "which predicts that an individual is infected with Covid-19 if and only if their test value is above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we will take a break from the serious stuff and learn about regular expression\n",
    "(or review regular expressions if you are already familiar).\n",
    "Regular expressions are a tool that you will almost certainly find useful for your entire CS career,\n",
    "and is especially useful when working with data (as you will be doing a lot).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. We will first set up a basic empirical risk minimization problem.\n",
    "2. Next, we will find a hypothesis that results in a small loss.\n",
    "3. Then, we will evaluate our solution and the associated risks of deployment.\n",
    "4. Finally, we will learn about all the core features of regular expressions."

    "## Part 1: Setting up the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will setup the empirical risk minimization problem we wish to solve, by:\n",
    " - Defining our variables of interest.\n",
    " - Choosing a \"hypothesis class\" $ \\mathcal{H} $, or space of possible solutions, that we will search.\n",
    " - Selecting a \"loss function\" $ L $ that will be minimized by our learned solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is about trying to come up with a function (usually called a *hypothesis*) that can make correct predictions as often as possible.\n",
    "The more our hypothesis is correct, the lower the *risk* of that hypothesis.\n",
    "A hypothesis that is always correct has zero risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real life, it's almost always impossible to make something that is always correct.\n",
    "(If we could, there would be no point in machine learning.)\n",
    "It's also impossible for us to always know when our hypothesis is right or wrong\n",
    "(imagine trying to predict something for every person in the world (past, present, and future)).\n",
    "We may know how our hypothesis performs on our small dataset,\n",
    "but we can't know how it will perform on all possible data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "So since we can't compute the true risk of a hypothesis, we instead approximate it by computing an *empirical risk*.\n",
    "To do this, we narrow down our set of data points from every possible data point to a known set of data (called our \"training data\").\n",
    "We can then compute our average loss over our training data to compute our empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - Mathematical Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's put our intuition from the previous section into math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is the **minimization** (over several possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $) of the expected loss (i.e. *risk*) of a hypothesis $ h $ with the data $ Z $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\mathbb{E}_Z \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So we want to select one hypothesis $ h $ from our set of possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $\n",
    "that minimizes the loss (risk) we expect to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are taking the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) ($ \\mathbb{E} $) over all possible values of the data.\n",
    "If you haven’t seen expectation before, we will discuss it in detail in a future module.\n",
    "But for now, you can think of expectation as the average value we would get if we randomly sampled infinite data points.\n",
    "For example, if we fairly picked random numbers between 1 and 99 (inclusive),\n",
    "then the expected value (expectation) would be 50.\n",
    "You can make a small Python program to try it out yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our training data $ Z = \\{z_1, z_2, z_3, ..., z_N \\} $, we can say that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N L(z_i, h)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This may look intimidating,\n",
    "but remember that $ L(z_i, h) $ is just a function that produces a single number.\n",
    "So if we say that our loss for the ith data point is $ L(z_i, h) = l_i $,\n",
    "then our equation looks like:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ l \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N l_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can see is just an average.\n",
    "So the key takeaway here is that the expectation is just an average over possible outcomes\n",
    "(in this case each data point is one possible outcome)."

    "In this part, we will learn how to evaluate our solution and consider the associated risks of deployment.\n",
    "In general, each of the steps we went through in previous parts are non-trivial and raises questions that are the subject of active research.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    " - Is our selection of variables appropriate, or do they induce bias in our predictor?\n",
    " - What loss functions naturally encode our objectives? Which have mathematical advantages? Which introduce systematic risks?\n",
    " - What algorithms are effective in which settings, and what theoretical results can we prove regarding speed, efficiency, or safety?\n",
    " - How do we use existing data effectively, again without introducing bias or systemic errors in our solutions?\n",
    " - Can our algorithms scale to larger datasets?\n",
    " - Can we choose algorithms that can guarantee our results are good enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have found the threshold titer value that minimizes Zero-One loss and therefore maximizes accuracy,\n",
    "accuracy (especially evaluated only on the data used for training) is not necessarily the best quantity to optimize.\n",
    "For example, our Covid-19 data only has about 5% of patients that are infected.\n",
    "Predicting False for all data points would give an accuracy of 95%.\n",
    "The accuracy may be high, but the predictor is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sometimes we care about certain types of errors more than others.\n",
    "Consider the following use for our titer-threshold classifier: we wish to screen visitors for entry to a ward of immunocompromised patients.\n",
    "If our classifier makes a mistake, we would rather it error on the side of caution and predict that someone has Covid-19 when they actually do not.\n",
    "This way even if we made an error, we protected the immunocompromised patients.\n",
    "In this example, optimizing for accuracy alone is not the best measure of utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification Errors\n",

    "### The ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to visualize the trade-offs between different types of binary classification errors is to plot the \"Receiver Operating Characteristics\" (ROC) (the name comes from using radar to classify incoming planes) of the classifier.\n",
    "ROC curves have true positive rate on the y-axis and false positive rate on the x-axis.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"roc-curve.png\"/></center>\n",
    "<center style='font-size: small'>Image courtesy of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roc_curve.svg'>Wikimedia Commons</a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, you can look at an ROC curve as how well your classifier performs as you move a threshold value.\n",
    "Starting at the origin of the x-axis, we have a zero false positive rate.\n",
    "This means that our classifier is very strict about predicting positive labels.\n",
    "But as we move along the x-axis, the false positive rate increases.\n",
    "Therefore, we get to see how our classifier performs as we become less and less strict about predicting positive labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the more area under the ROC curve, the better.\n",
    "In fact, there is a metric that just calculates the area under an ROC curve: [Area Under the ROC Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) (AUC or AuROC for short).\n",
    "\n",
    "**This step depends on most of the previous tasks.**"

    "\n",
    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (also called \"regexp\" or \"regex\") are patterns that let you find matching text.\n",
    "Think of them like mathematical expressions for text (an equation can define a line (collection of points), and a regex can define a collection of strings).\n",
    "When starting off, regular expressions can be pretty confusing.\n",
    "But once you get comfortable using them, you start to see how they can be used in almost all of your everyday coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"xkcd-regular-expressions.png\"/ width=600px></center>\n",
    "<center style='font-size: small'>Comic courtesy of <a href='https://xkcd.com/208'>xkcd</a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from this assignment, here are some resources on regular expressions that you may find helpful:\n",
    " - [Text Tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-regex/)\n",
    " - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa-TUpSx1JA)\n",
    " - [Cheat Sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)\n",
    " - [Regex Playground](https://regex101.com/) (Interactively create, test, and visualize regular expressions.)\n",
    " - [Python Regex Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with regular expressions, make sure to take your time.\n",
    "Treat a regular expression as a dense piece of code.\n",
    "You don't expect to look at a code file and understand everything right away,\n",
    "you take things piece by piece.\n",
    "Do the same thing with regular expressions,\n",
    "take it slow and look at them piece by piece."

    "### Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in directly or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### re.search()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment (and probably most of your Python regex usage),\n",
    "we will be using the method `re.search()`.\n",
    "`re.search()` takes two required arguments,\n",
    "first the regex and then the string to search in (we will often call this the \"target\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another method `re.match()` that is subtly different,\n",
    "and you will probably want to avoid.\n",
    "`re.search()` looks for a match within a string (and it can be the entire string).\n",
    "`re.match()` tries to match **the beginning** of a string (and that can mean the entire string).\n",
    "Later in this assignment, we will discuss how to recreate the functionality of `re.match()`\n",
    "in a more explicit and less error-pone way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace)).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",
    "In fact, in Python strings are used to represent regular expressions.\n",
    "So most strings are already regular expressions\n",
    "(but arbitrary strings may contain special symbols which are not valid regular expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the string `\"foo\"` can be used as a regular expression to match \"foo\", \"food\", \"foo bar\",\n",
    "and literally infinite other strings that have “foo” as a substring."
